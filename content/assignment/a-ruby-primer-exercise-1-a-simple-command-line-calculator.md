In this exercise, you will create a Ruby script for a simple command line calculator.

### Specification
- **File Name:** *simple-calculator.rb*
- **Input:** *Several strings containing your name, the user's name, integers, and floats.*
- **Output:** *Several strings containing various prompts and the results of various arithmetic calculations.*
- **Methods Used:** *puts, print, gets, to_i, to_f, to_s (for floats)*

### Sample Output
``` text
Welcome to the Simple Calculator by Disciples of Code
Please enter your name: Clark Kent
Hello, Clark Kent
Let's try some addition!
Please enter a number to add: 1.55
Please enter another number to add: 4
The result of adding 1.55 plus 4 is: 5.55
Let's try some subtraction!
Please enter a number to subtract: 7.33
Please enter another number to subtract: 2.33
The result of subtracting 2.33 from 7.33 is: 5.0
Let's try some multiplication!
Please enter a number to multiply: 2
Please enter another number to multiply: 5.12
The result of multiplying 2 times 5.12 is: 10.24
Let's try some division!
Please enter a number to divide: 8.78
Please enter another number to divide: 2.2
The result of dividing 8.78 by 2.2 is: 3.9909090909090903
Thank you for using the Simple Calculator!
