If you have not yet set up your development environment, please refer to [Part 1]({{ root_url }}/2014/03/a-ruby-primer-part-1-setting-up-your-development-environment/) of this primer.

If you are unfamiliar with using the Ruby Interactive Shell, please refer to [Part 3]({{ root_url }}/2014/03/a-ruby-primer-part-3-ruby-scripts/) of this primer.

### Terms
> **Hash:** *A hash is an associative collection of unique keys and their values.* [Ruby documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Hash.html)

### Hashes in Ruby

Ruby allows us to create dictionary-like objects, called hashes, which are associative collections of unique key-value pairs. Hashes are similar to arrays, but can use any object as an index, as opposed to the integer index that arrays use.

In Ruby, we define a hash using curly braces (\{\}) and a colon (':') after the key (if the key is a [Ruby symbol](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Symbol.html)), or a hash rocket ('=>') after the key (if the key is a string). (*Note that we will be discussing Ruby symbols later in this primer, but for now, keep in mind that after creating a symbol using a colon **after** the symbol name, you can access the symbol by putting a colon **before** the symbol name.*) Like other literals, we can assign hashes to variables.

From IRB, let's see hashes in action.

``` irb Hash literals
irb(main):001:0> secret_id = {"Superman" => "Clark Kent", "Wonder Woman" => "Diana Prince", "Batman" => "Bruce Wayne", "Green Lantern" => "Alan Scott", "The Flash" => "Jay Garrick"}
=> {"Superman"=>"Clark Kent", "Wonder Woman"=>"Diana Prince", "Batman"=>"Bruce Wayne", "Green Lantern"=>"Alan Scott", "The Flash"=>"Jay Garrick"}
irb(main):002:0> secret_id["Superman"]
=> "Clark Kent"
irb(main):003:0> secret_id["Green Lantern"]
=> "Alan Scott"
irb(main):004:0> first_appearance = {superman: 1938, wonder_woman: 1941, batman: 1939, green_lantern: 1940, the_flash: 1940}
irb(main):005:0> first_appearance[:wonder_woman]
=> 1941
irb(main):006:0> first_appearance[:the_flash]
=> 1940
```

Ruby provides many useful hash methods. We recommend exploring the [Ruby documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Hash.html) and trying out some of these on your own to gain a better understanding. We will be using various hash methods throughout the rest of this primer.

Congratulations! You have learned about some of the basic ways to use the hash data type.
