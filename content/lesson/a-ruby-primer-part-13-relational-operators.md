### Comparisons in Ruby

As discussed in [Part 7]({{ root_url }}/2014/04/a-ruby-primer-part-7-booleans/) of this primer, Ruby provides the standard boolean values of 'true' and 'false, and the standard relational (comparison) operations of is equal to, is not equal to, is greater than, is less than, is greater than or equal to, is less than or equal to through the relational operators '==', '!=', '>', '<', '>=', and '<=', respectively. Ruby also provides a combined (or general) comparison operator, '<=>', which returns a 0 if the first operand is equal to the second, 1 if the first operand is greater than the second, or -1 if the first operand is less than the second.

From IRB, let's see the relational (comparison) operators in action.

``` irb Relational (comparison) operators
irb(main):001> 1 == 1
=> true
irb(main):002> 2 == 1
=> false
irb(main):003> 1 != 1
=> false
irb(main):004> 2 != 1
=> true
irb(main):005> 1 > 2
=> false
irb(main):006> 2 > 2
=> false
irb(main):007> 3 > 2
=> true
irb(main):008> 1 < 2
=> true
irb(main):009> 2 < 2
=> false
irb(main):010> 3 < 2
=> false
irb(main):011> 1 >= 2
=> false
irb(main):012> 2 >= 2
=> true
irb(main):013> 3 >= 2
=> true
irb(main):014> 1 <= 2
=> true
irb(main):015> 2 <= 2
=> true
irb(main):016> 3 <= 2
=> false
irb(main):017> 1 <=> 2
=> -1
irb(main):018> 2 <=> 2
=> 0
irb(main):019> 3 <=> 2
=> 1
```

Ruby allows us to use the relational (comparison) operators on strings. Keep in mind that string comparisons are case-sensitive, and that letters that come alphabetically before or after their case-sensitive counterpart (e.g. 'a' compared to 'b', or 'B' compared to 'A') are less than or greater than, respectively.

From IRB, let's see the relational (comparison) operators in action on strings.

``` irb Relational (comparison) operators
irb(main):020> "ant" == "ant"
=> true
irb(main):021> "Ant" == "ant"
=> false
irb(main):022> "bear" < "bear"
=> false
irb(main):023> "bear" < "beaver"
=> true
```

Congratulations! You have learned about relational operators.
