> **Variable:** *A variable is a symbolic name associated with some value, whether known or unknown.* [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science))
>
> **Constant:** *A constant is a symbolic name associated with some known value, that is not intended to change.* [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(programming))

### Variables in Ruby

Ruby allows us to create variables to store any object available in Ruby. We can name our variable **almost** anything we want, but there are a few rules that we must follow:

- All variables must begin with either a lowercase letter or an underscore ('_').
- After the first letter (or underscore) of a variable, the variable name can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores.

When naming variables, the **proper** standard practice is to use meaningful variable names (e.g. rate instead of r, or publication_date instead of date) that reduce abiguity and confusion for anyone reading your code (yourself included). For complex variable names (e.g. positive_numbers_under_ten), the Ruby convention is to use underscore to separate the words in the complex variable name. (*Note that in other languages, [CamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) is often used. This is purely a convention and stylistic choice of many Ruby programmers. You are free to use either in your own Ruby code.*)

In Ruby, we create a variable through an assignment operation, using the binary operator '='. Ruby is smart enough to figure out what data type the variable should be, so that we do not have to specify a data type when creating a variable.

From IRB, let's see variable creation and assignment in action.

``` irb Variable creation and assignment
irb(main):001:0> letter = "a"
=> "a"
irb(main):002:0> letter
=> "a"
irb(main):003:0> _number = 42
=> 42
irb(main):004:0> _number
=> 42
irb(main):005:0> first_name = "Clark"
=> "Clark"
irb(main):006:0> lastName = "Kent"
=> "Kent"
irb(main):007:0> date_of_first_appearance_of_superman = 1938
=> 1938
```

### Constants in Ruby

Ruby allows us to create constants, by using **all** uppercase letters in the name of our constant (e.g. TAU = 6.28319). (*Note that in Ruby, a constant isn't really constant, and can be changed at a later point in your program. However, the convention in Ruby is that constants should **not** be changed. Ruby will give you a warning when you try to reassign a constant, but will go ahead and do the reassignment anyway.*)

From IRB, let's see constant creation and assignment in action.

``` irb Constant creation and assignment
irb(main):008:0> TAU = 6.28319
=> 6.28319
irb(main):009:0> TAU
=> 6.28319
irb(main):010:0> SITE_NAME = "Disciples of Code"
=> "Disciples of Code"
irb(main):011:0> SITE_NAME
=> "Disciples of Code"
irb(main):012:0> SITE_NAME = "Your Really Awesome Site"
(irb):12: warning: already initializaed constant SITE_NAME
(irb):11: warning: previous definition of SITE_NAME was here
=> "Your Really Awesome Site"
irb(main):013:0> SITE_NAME
=> "Your Really Awesome Site"
```

We will be using variables and constant throughout the rest of this primer.

Congratulations! You have learned about some of the basic ways to create and assign values to variables and constants.
